                    <h2>Hybrid Consensus Mechanism</h2>
                    <div id="info-box-bar"></div>
                    <p>In the hybrid Proof-of-Stake/Proof-of-Bandwidth consensus mechanism, validators are selected based on both their staked
                       tokens and their contributions of bandwidth to the network. This would incentivise validators to
                       not only hold a significant stake in the network, but also provide reliable and fast network
                       connectivity to ensure the network’s stability and performance. A hybrid mechanism like this
                       provides a more balanced and robust approach to consensus that takes into account both token
                       ownership and network connectivity.</p>

                    <h2>NTRUencrypt Asymmetric Encryption</h2>
                    <div id="info-box-bar"></div>
                    <p>The Valency Network utilises a Post-Quantum Asymmetric Encryption Algorithm called
                       NTRUencrypt (N-th Degree Truncated Polynomial Ring Units). NTRU is lattice-based instead
                       of prime-based, completely eliminating the possibility of solving using Shor’s Algorithm on a
                       quantum computer.</p>

                    <h2>Traceable Ring Signatures</h2>
                    <div id="info-box-bar"></div>
                    <p>On the Valency Network, Traceable Ring Signatures allow the sender of a transaction on the
                       Valency Network to remain completely anonymous whilst still retaining the ability for nodes to
                       verify the transaction.</p>

                    <div id="info-box-bar"></div>
                    <p>Stealth Addresses are a privacy-enhancing technique used in the Valency Network. They enable
                       the receiver of a transaction to use a one-time, disposable public address derived from their
                       private key, making it extremely difficult to link transactions to the actual recipient. This
                       increases privacy and anonymity of the users.</p>

                <div class="info-sharding" id="info-box">               <!--- Sharding -->
                    <h2>Sharding</h2>
                    <div id="info-box-bar"></div>
                    <p>Sharding is a scaling solution for blockchains that aims to improve the efficiency and
                       throughput of the network by dividing it into smaller, manageable pieces called shards. Each
                       shard processes a subset of the transactions, allowing for parallel processing and increasing the
                       overall capacity of the network. Sharding helps to alleviate the limitations of traditional
                       blockchain systems, where every node is required to validate and store all transactions, leading
                       to slow transaction times high resource usage.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-containerization" id="info-box">       <!--- Containerization -->
                    <h2>Containerization</h2>
                    <div id="info-box-bar"></div>
                    <p>One of the main bandwidth limitations the network will have to cope with it when a new node is
                       downloading the required shards to be able to partake in the network. Since a blockchain consists of
                       every transaction ever made within that particular network, the overall size can be substantial and
                       continues to grow as new blocks are added.
                       Containerization is a process that compresses shards on the blockchain and large blocks on up to date
                       nodes before sending to other nodes. This compressed data can then be decompressed and processed
                       normally. This decreases the time it takes for a node to get set up on the network.</p>

                <div class="info-onionrouting" id="info-box">           <!--- Onion Routing -->
                    <h2>Onion Routing</h2>
                    <div id="info-box-bar"></div>
                    <p>Onion Routing is used in the Valency Network to remove governmental/malicious control of
                       the users, as people will not have to worry about their identities being revealed through a
                       leaked IP address.
                       Multiple layers of encryption and message routing makes it exponentially harder for malicious
                       entities to trace the IP address of the message sender and message contents through
                       eavesdropping and traffic analysis attacks.</p>
